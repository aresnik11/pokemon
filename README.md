# Pokémon

Welcome to my Pokémon app!

This app is a work in progress that will allow users to search for the original 150 Pokémon and see information about them, from the PokéAPI.

The frontend and backend are contained within this repo. The frontend is built with React and the backend is built with Ruby on Rails and a PostgreSQL DB.
